I'm a Senior Security Engineer and Cybersecurity Manager with a passion for building secure, scalable systems that protect critical dataâ€”especially in highly regulated industries like healthcare. With hands-on experience in cloud-native and on-prem environments, I focus on designing solutions that balance security, performance, and compliance.

My work spans vulnerability management, incident response, threat detection, and automating security controls across tools like CrowdStrike, Okta, SailPoint, Proofpoint, AWS, GCP, and more. I believe in "security by design," integrating DevSecOps practices into development workflows and scripting in Python and Google Apps Script to streamline operations.

Fun fact: The domain [borntosting.com](https://www.borntosting.com) isn't just a clever name, it's a nod to my beloved Kia Stinger. Yes, I named a whole website after my car. Some people name their kids; I name my domains. Priorities, right?
