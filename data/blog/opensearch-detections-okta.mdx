Okta logs are full of useful security signals. They’re also full of noise. Sifting through them manually? That's a hard no. We needed a way to reliably detect risky activity, send alerts to our SOC, and not burn hours staring at a log viewer like it owes us money.

Here’s how I set up automated detections in OpenSearch that monitor Okta logs, trigger on specific patterns, and call a Python webhook to create Jira tickets for our SOC to review. It’s not magic. It’s YAML, Python, and a healthy mistrust of everything in a login audit trail.

### Why Automate Okta Log Detections?

Because:

- Suspicious logins don’t announce themselves.
- Brute force attempts happen quietly.
- Users do weird things. Often.

You _could_ wait for something to blow up. Or, you could monitor for patterns that actually mean something and reduce your detection-to-ticket pipeline to a few seconds.

### The Setup

- Okta tenant streaming logs to a centralized location
- OpenSearch (Elasticsearch fork, but with less licensing drama) with alerting plugins
- Python webhook endpoint that handles POSTs and pushes to Jira
- Jira for tracking and escalation

### What to Detect in Okta Logs

Okta logs come with a ton of event types. Here are a few that you probably want to keep an eye on:

1. Impossible Travel

- `eventType`: `user.session.start`
- Check for IP geo-location jumps that defy the laws of physics (e.g., login from New York, then 2 minutes later from Singapore).
- Bonus: Integrate MaxMind or similar to resolve IPs to locations.

2. Brute Force or Spray Attempts

- `eventType`: `user.authentication.failed`
- Watch for high volumes of login failures from the same IP or targeting multiple accounts
- Correlate with `user.authentication.sso` or `user.account.lock` events

3. MFA Fatigue (Yes, That’s a Thing Now)

- Multiple `user.mfa.challenge` followed by success after N attempts
- High volume of challenges without success, then one successful push. Looks sketchy? It probably is.

4. Privilege Escalation

- `eventType`: `user.account.privilege.grant`
- Or anything related to group changes (group.user_membership.add)
- Especially if the user granting access is the same user receiving it. Sneaky.

### OpenSearch Monitors

OpenSearch monitors let you define:

- Query: DSL that filters logs based on your detection pattern
- Trigger: Conditions under which an alert is fired
- Action: Where to send the alert (in our case, to a webhook)

Example: detecting impossible travel

```python
"query": {
  "bool": {
    "must": [
      { "match": { "eventType": "user.session.start" } },
      { "range": { "geo_distance": { "gte": "5000km" } } }
    ]
  }
}
```

(Yes, this is simplified. You’ll need to correlate timestamps and session IDs yourself. Enjoy.)

Then define a trigger:

```python
"trigger": {
  "condition": {
    "script": {
      "source": "ctx.results[0].hits.total.value > 0"
    }
  }
}
```

And send it to your webhook:

```python
"actions": [
  {
    "name": "Send to Python Webhook",
    "destination": {
      "endpoint": "https://myendpoint.company.com/okta-detections"
    },
    "message": "Possible impossible travel detected for user {{ctx.results.0.hits.hits.0._source.actor.alternateId}}"
  }
]
```

### The Python Webhook

This endpoint receives POSTs from OpenSearch and creates a Jira ticket. Here’s the basic flow:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/okta-detections', methods=['POST'])
def handle_alert():
    data = request.json
    user = data['ctx']['results'][0]['hits']['hits'][0]['_source']['actor']['alternateId']
    summary = f"Security Alert: Suspicious Okta Activity for {user}"

    jira_payload = {
        "fields": {
            "project": {"key": "SEC"},
            "summary": summary,
            "description": str(data),
            "issuetype": {"name": "Task"}
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(
        "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue",
        json=jira_payload,
        auth=("your-jira-user", "your-jira-api-token")
    )

    return {"status": "Ticket created", "jira_response": response.json()}
```

Yes, error handling is missing. So is authentication. You’re in security. You’ll figure it out.

### Final Thoughts

This setup makes detections visible, trackable, and reviewable without relying on someone to be staring at dashboards 24/7.

Could you plug this into Slack or Teams? Sure. But Jira makes sure it doesn’t vanish into the noise. Plus, SOC needs a ticket to say they did the thing.

And now, a question for you:
What other Okta patterns should we flag? Suspicious admin tool use? Or maybe the classic “deactivate-reactivate-reactivate” shuffle?
